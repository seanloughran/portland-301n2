### Git Hints

Before checking in or creating a new branch, you should perform the following:

```
git pull origin master
git pull upstream master
git push origin master
```

This will sync your master with the class's master repo and help avoid conflicts.

# Learning Objectives

#### RESTful endpoints & External APIs:

2. Understand the history of HTTP, and the central role that REST plays.
3. Use RESTful routes for a web service, to retrieve their own github repos
4. Design RESTful endpoints for their own blogging app

# Lecture

REST is an architectural style for distributed systems.

REST is similiar to the CRUD methods on a Model or SQL table.

* Create - POST
* Read   - GET
* Upate  - PUT
* Delete - DELETE

The URL defines the resource, the HTTP verb the ACTION: 

```
POST /api/users/1234

{
'first_name' : 'John',
'last_name': 'Smith'

}
```

```
PUT /api/users/1234

{
'first_name' : 'Jack',
'last_name': 'Smith'

}
```

```
GET /api/users
```

```
GET /api/users/1234
```

```
DELETE /api/users/1234
```
