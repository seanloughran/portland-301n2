## vw and vh

[source](https://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/)

One unit on any of the three values is 1% of the viewport axis. "Viewport" == browser window size == window object. If the viewport is 40cm wide, 1vw == 0.4cm.

For use with `font-size`, I guess it's one "letter" that takes on that size, but as we know, in non-mono-spaced fonts the width of a letter is rather arbitrary.

```
1vw = 1% of viewport width
1vh = 1% of viewport height
1vmin = 1vw or 1vh, whichever is smaller
1vmax = 1vw or 1vh, whichever is larger
```
