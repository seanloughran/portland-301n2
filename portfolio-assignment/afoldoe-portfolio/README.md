Changed data storage from localStorage to webDB for consistent loading. Added a createTable(); function for creating the table, updateProject(); to overwrite old project rows in the database with new information to the corresponding rows, truncateTable(); clears out the entire table if needed, deleteProject(); deletes one Project instance in the table.
