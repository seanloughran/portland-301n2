I am a big Instagram fan, unfortunately their API isn't so intuitive.</p><p>It was a great learning process to read the docs and user forums. I had to figure out how some things about user access tokens, and JSONP. I'm not sure if JSONP is really required here, if an instructor looks at my code perhaps they could tell me. The animations aren't perfect, but it works!</p><p>I would really like to come back to this project someday in the near future, although the functionality that can be added with Instagram's API does seem a little limited.</p>",

It doesn't serve any real purpose, it does have working functionality that many webpages have though.</p><p>It makes use of jQuery plugins, BootStrap, and is completely mobile responsive. This was one of the first projects I used the Googlemaps API on as well, which provided me the grounds to start with skaterPortland. click around and see how you like it :)</p><p> The content in the app is centered around a story telling theme, which was inspired by a simple app idea I had. I wanted to create an app that would allow a user to write a story of some kind and then either keep the story or 'cast-away' the story. Once a user cast away their story another user could find it based on their geographical location. Different geographical locations around Portland would populate the stories in one of the three pages served from the index file.</p> <p>For example, if the user was in the Gorge area, they would see stories 'cast-away' by users who had cast them away in that area. A user in Forest Park would see stories cast away in that area... and so on.",

"text":"<p>My most recent project for the Code Fellows 301 entrance test, by far the best programming experience I've had so far.</p><p>I sat in on a 201 course where Al Shae described the students gave the students their final project. I decided to take on basically the same assignment the students were given and code my own app within a week.The project took me more time than that of course. Orignially I coded only in JavaScript, now I'm in the process of modularizing the code with requirejs and rewriting all of it using jQuery as well.</p><p>I have the goal to keep working on this project and add a database to store skate locations. Lots of user interaction to be modified as well. One of my favorite parts of this project was implementing the mobile responsive CSS and JS. Try resizing the window and using the iPhone window in the developer toos :) Feedback is appreciated!</p>",
